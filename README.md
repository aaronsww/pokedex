## Project Summary

This project is a small Library application that logs and tracks various books for a specific user. I learned how to write object constructors and instantiate objects, while combining it with the DOM.

### Functionality:

<ul>
    <li>Add a book, along with details such as title, author and total number of pages.</li>
    <li>Mark if it's read or not.</li>
    <li>Delete a particular book from the library.</li>
</ul>
